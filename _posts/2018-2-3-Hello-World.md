title: Hello Jekyll World

Hello World,

I started getting into some new technical topics recently, and wanted to blog about them. But since my old blog is down, I decided to start anew.

Since the new trend is about static sites, and I can host one easily with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I'm doing just that. I'm using [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) as a theme for now.

I might try to salvage my old posts from the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20130610051018/abderrahim.arablug.org/blog/), but I'm just leaving this link for now.

Anyway, welcome to my new blog, and stay tuned for updates.
